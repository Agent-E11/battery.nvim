# battery.nvim
Neovim plugin to collect and view information on battery power in your status line.

Features
- Gracefully handle no battery (either remove battery info from the status line or just show a desktop icon)
- Show charge level and whether there is a power cable attached or not via icons (requires [kyazdani42/nvim-web-devicons](https://github.com/kyazdani42/nvim-web-devicons))
- Configurable update rate

Inspired by [lambdalisue/battery.vim](https://github.com/lambdalisue/battery.vim).
